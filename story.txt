    The Werewolf Chronicleshttp://www.infinite-story.com/story/1825/	Begin journey	002		000 The late afternoon sun casts   out its soft orange glow as it  begins to set over the horizon. Your motorcycle trip around     Bulgaria has been brilliant so  far. In this beautiful part of  the country you have seen       mountains, forests and quaint   little villages one after       another all day. You accelerate faster on your   bike along the windy road in themountains hoping to find a small town or village up ahead where you could stop for some good    home cooked food, maybe sample  some good Bulgarian ale and get a soft bed for the night.       Rounding along the next few     bends you see a small village   down in the valley below. 	Next Page	003		000There are only a few wooden     buildings grouped together, it's not much but you have no other choice because the sun has      almost disappeared over the     horizon. You stop your bike in  front of an old wooden  building with a soft warm light shining out through the shuters. There  is a weatherworn wooden  sign   hanging above you that says     something in Bulgarian with a   picture of a wolf next to it.	Go in	004	Walk around the village	010You walk in and find yourself in a small and cozy little place that might be a guesthouse. There is a couple huddled together   over a small table in the corner, a mother and a young baby in  front of a roaring fire, a      couple of men playing cards and an old man sitting near the     doorway where you are. No one   says anything or even looks up  at you standing there, except   the old man next to you. In     front of him, on the table, his white knuckles tightly grip a   large double-barreled shotgun.  You feel his eyes stare straight though you as  he says bluntly in broken English "No strangers here, leave now,  out the door you came in."The old man picks up the shotgun and waves it at the door.	Explain yourself	005	Maybe you should leave	013Listen I'm not here to bring you any trouble, I just need       something to eat and a nice bed to sleep in. I have more than   enough to pay for it and...""Are you deaf and stupid        stranger!" the old man yells,   "Out now or I'll shoot you like a dog on the spot." Spittle flies out of his mouth  and it lands on your face. For  some reason you don't really    feel welcome here.	You're determined to stay	006	Leave now	013You look around at the others in the room but no one looks up at you. Determined to have a meal and a bed, despite the ravings  of this lunatic with a gun in   front of you, your feet remain  planted on the spot. "This one's as stubborn as my son" the old man blurts out, "Sit down over there."His gun is pointed over at an   empty chair in the corner. The  old man says something to the   others in Bulgarian and then he sits down again and mumbles something to himself. Obviously     deranged you think.	Next page	007		000You sit down. You're starting to get hungry now, and while you  have a little food in your bag, you're afraid to open it really. You want to ask for food and   your afraid to do that too. No  one has even looked at you yet  except the old man who's been   staring at you intensely for the past hour. He's now nodding off asleep with the gun still in   his hands. When the old man's   head is hung low you try to     contact one of these silent     mannequin people. "Could I get some food and maybe a bed around here, do you?" you say with a forced half smile. She looks over at the two men playing cards and they all speak together in Bulgarian before one of the men answers. 	Next Page	008		000You will get some food and a bed if you can pay for it. And     stranger, do your best to try to avoid my uncle." The man looks over at the now dozing old man. "He lost his mind two months ago when his son disappeared. Now  some think my cousin..." The man trails off, "has become a      walking beast of the night. It  will be best for you to eat, go to your room and lock the door. At dawn you should leave this   place and never come back. This whole village has had a curse   placed upon it and it will be   unwise for you to ask more      questions tonight." The man then resumes his card   game and some time later, the   women you talked to before,     comes out with some food for you. You eat it  quickly and then  she shows you your room for the night.	Get some sleep	009		000To be continued...		000		000There isn't really much to see  in this little village. It's    late and there isn't anyone     about. The only building with   any lights on is the old wooden building where you parked your  bike. Up ahead you see a small  trail that leads off into the   forest.	Back to the building and go in	004	Follow the trail	011The stony trail is narrow, windy and really dark. More than once you scratch yourself on the    overhanging branches. Your going nowhere walking along a trail  in the darkness of a Bulgarian  forest, it doesn't really seem  like a good idea. After a minute more, you are just about to    turn around when you see a      looming shadow up ahead. Under  the light of the full moon you  see a derelict little wooden hut nestled under a large dead     tree. There doesn't seem to be  anyone home.	Go in	012	Follow the trail more	009The hut smells a bit damp and   dusty. Obviously no one has been here for a long time. In the   darkness you can make out the   wooden frame of a bed in one    corner and a wooden table in    another. There doesn't seem to  be anything else in the room.   Behind you is a stone fireplace. You're really hungry now and   the little food you have with   you in your bag you eat quickly. You feel pretty tired now and a little cold.	Make a fire	009	Get some sleep	009It's late, your hungry and you  have nowhere to sleep. You don't want to stay in a guesthouse   with a grumpy old man that might blow your brains out with a    shotgun. What are your choices  now? There isn't anyone about   and the only building with any  lights on is the old guesthouse. Up ahead you see a small trail that leads off into the forest. Maybe you could head down here, wait and sneak back into an     empty house somewhere when      everyone is asleep.	Follow the trail	011		000
