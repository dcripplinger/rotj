There are plenty of men in the lands round about Zarahemla, but none are sent. All entries to the area have been blockaded off so that we cannot intervene. Our judges have grown comfortable sitting upon their throwns in peace while our men continue to die defending the outer cities. Word is they may have even opened communication with Ammoron to strike some sort of a deal. ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ And it came to pass that Moroni was angry with the government, because of their indifference concerning the freedom of their country. ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ Moroni: Pahoran will grant me an audience, whether or not he wishes it! ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~ Gidgiddoni: The only way I can think of entering Zarahemla is through the north side above Gideon.
