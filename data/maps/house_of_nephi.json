Some of the lower judges have already been compromised. The society was founded by a man named Gadianton, and they call themselves the Gadianton Robbers. While I was undercover, I learned a password they use to detect other members of the band. I think we can use this password to trick a lower judge into revealing himself as a member, and then we can force him to lead us to where Gadianton himself is hiding. Pacumeni is one of the brothers of Pahoran, and has taken his place as chief judge. We can trust him. But we'll have to go palace by palace to the other judges to find one that is a member of the Gadianton Robbers. Have you prepared everything you need?",
