Start out with Pahoran telling Moronihah that Nephi had an important message he needed to deliver to him personally and to meet him at his house. But when you get there, he's not there because something bad happened to him and his servant is worried. The servant says the last person that visited him was Alma, who lives in Zarahemla. In Zarahemla, Alma says he can help, but he's worried sick about his son Corianton and asks you to bring him home. He says he was helping defind Lehi (or Morianton?), or that he thought he enlisted with your army, or that he had been entranced by a harlot and didn't know where he was. You bring Corianton back, have him in front, talk to Alma, and Corianton leaves your party and stays with Alma. Alma tells you that Nephi has been undercover spying on an emerging secret band to find out their plans and stop them, but something must have gone wrong. Last Alma heard, Nephi went to a secret meeting in one of the grottos in the desert caves. You find Nephi there unconscious and you wake him up. He says he was found out and they attacked him. They're probably moving up their timetable for their plan to murder the chief judge. We need to try and get there to stop them before it's too late. We get there and Pahoran is dead. Nephi shows up while we examine the body and says we're too late. He says he must gather his things at his house and for you to meet him there and he will help you put a stop to the Gadianton Robbers. You go to his house, and Nephi explains that Pacumeni is the new chief judge, and we can trust him, but we don't know which other judges are secretly in Gadianton's band. But he knows a password we can use to trick the bad judges to reveal themselves. Nephi joins you.
